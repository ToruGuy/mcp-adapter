# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive research_assistant.py example demonstrating integration of Filesystem and Memory MCP servers
- time_example.py example showing Time MCP server integration
- Added claude_learnings directory with detailed MCP analysis documents for education
- Added unit tests for core/tools.py (9 passing tests)
- Added unit tests for core/logger.py (7 passing tests)
- Added test runner script with proper reporting

### Fixed
- Standardized error handling across examples
- Improved docstrings and comments for better code documentation
- Added proper client closure in finally blocks for all examples
- Fixed unused variables and bare except blocks
- Added tool call validation before execution
- Improved TypeScript type annotations and return type consistency

### Notes for MCP Learners
- MCP adapter provides a clean way to integrate multiple specialized servers into Python applications
- Examples demonstrate the pattern of:
  1. Initialize MCP clients
  2. Get tools from clients
  3. Combine tools in MCPTools
  4. Configure LLM adapter with tools
  5. Use LLM to generate tool calls
  6. Execute tool calls on appropriate clients
- The research_assistant.py example shows how to build practical applications combining multiple servers (Filesystem + Memory)
- Error handling is critical - always close clients properly in finally blocks
- Always validate tool call results before executing them
- Knowledge graph capabilities in the Memory server enable building sophisticated relationship-based applications
- Proper testing helps ensure reliability of MCP integrations
